    - core/drupalSettings # To pass data from PHP to JavaScript.
    # - bootstrap5/bootstrap5 # Dependency on the base theme's main library if needed.
    #   If you are compiling Bootstrap SASS into your style.css, you might not need this,
    #   or you might need it for Bootstrap's JS.
    #   The `base theme: bootstrap5` in info.yml should handle JS.
    #   The `libraries-override` in info.yml can prevent double-loading of CSS.
