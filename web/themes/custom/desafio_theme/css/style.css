/*
  This is the compiled CSS file for the Desafio Theme.
  It is generated from the SASS files in the 'scss' directory.

  TO POPULATE THIS FILE:
  1. Ensure you have a SASS compiler installed (e.g., Dart SASS).
     You can install it globally via npm: `npm install -g sass`
  2. Navigate to the root of your Drupal project in the terminal.
  3. Run the SASS compilation command:
     `sass web/themes/custom/desafio_theme/scss/style.scss web/themes/custom/desafio_theme/css/style.css`
  4. Alternatively, if you have set up Gulp or Webpack as per the extended plan,
     use the appropriate command (e.g., `gulp sass`, `npm run build`).

  Do not edit this file directly, as your changes will be overwritten
  the next time you compile the SASS files.
  Make all your style changes in the .scss files.
